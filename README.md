# NLP_Analysis
Three part NLP project.  First, we scraped employee reviews and ratings from Indeed.com.  Next, we processed the data by removing contractions, lemmatizing, tokenization, etc.  Finally, we analyzed the data by summarizing the data, determining employee sentiment and performing topic modeling.
